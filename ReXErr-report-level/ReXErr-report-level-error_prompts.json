Ensure that the opposites are clear and evident either between the findings and impressions sections of the report. The added sentence should demonstrate a clear inconsistency in the medical assessment and between NEW findings (not findings from prior reports).

Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\nERROR REPORT (what you should output): No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Impression: Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.\nEXPLANATION: Findings in output say no pleural effusion and small pleural effusion so there is an opposite injected.\n\n#2: \nORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: Diffuse bilateral mainly basilar parenchymal opacities consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Impression: Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions and cardiomegaly consistent with congestive heart failure.\nERROR REPORT (what you should output): Findings: There are bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities with a perihilar predominance, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.\u00a0\u00a0There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Impression: 1.\u00a0\u00a0Mild pulmonary edema. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Small bilateral pleural effusions.\nEXPLANATION: Findings in output say moderate pulmonary edema and mild pulmonary edema so there is an conflict between moderate and mild\n\n#3\nORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: Single frontal radiograph of the chest was performed and reveals no acute cardiopulmonary process. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\nERROR REPORT (what you should output): Findings: There is increased opacity in the left upper lobe and right upper lobe, which may represent multifocal pneumonia.

It is not enough to simply negate the finding within a single sentence. There should be two separate sentences in the final error report which directly contradict one another.\n", "11": "[priority error] change a particular finding from the report from present to absent by changing a sentence to indicate absence of the positive clinical finding. When you change the finding, remove all details associated with the original finding: for example severity, location, and additional details that would only be relevant if the finding existed. Only change POSITIVE findings (i.e., you can remove 'cardiomegaly' but not 'the heart is normal in size'). Do not change NEGATIVE findings to positive findings. DO NOT REMOVE/OMIT SENTENCES FROM THE ORIGINAL REPORT. Negative findings include heart is normal, lungs are clear, cardiac/mediastinal/hilar contours are normal. Here are some examples:\n\nFinding: \u201cClips project over the left lung, potentially within the breast.\u201d \nWhat not to do: \u201cClips do not project over the left lung, potentially within the breast.\u201d \nWhat you should do:\u201cNo clips seen\u201d as this removes all details (where the clips were seen). \nExplanation: Clips projecting over a lung is a positive clinical finding, so you can change this sentence. Leaving in the details, such as  the left lung and the breast is not relevant when there is no finding, hence they should not be included in the negation.\n\nFinding: \u201cNo pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.\u201d \nWhat not to do: \u201cThere is a right pleural effusion.\u201d \nExplanation: Saying that there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is NOT a positive finding, so you should not change this sentence\n\nFinding: \u201cBilateral nodular opacities that most likely represent nipple shadows\u201d\nWhat not to do: \u201cNo bilateral nodular opacities that most likely represent nipple shadows.\u201d \nWhat you should do: \u201cNo nodular opacities\u201d as this also removes location. \nExplanation: This is a positive finding, so you can change it. \"bilateral nodular opacities\" and \"nipple shadows\" are both not relevant at all when there is no finding, meaning that they should be removed in the negation.\n\nFinding: \"There are innumerable bilateral scattered small pulmonary nodules which are better demonstrated on recent CT.\"\nWhat not to do: \"There are no discernible bilateral scattered small pulmonary nodules.\"\nWhat you should do: \u201cNo pulmonary nodules.\u201d\nExplanation: The presence of nodules is a positive findings, but their location is irrelvant when nodules are not present so they should not be mentioned in the negation.\n\nFinding: \"Otherwise, the lungs are clear.\"\nWhat not to do not do: \"No abnormal lung findings are noted.\"\nExplanation: Saying that the lungs are clear is NOT a positive finding, so you should not change this sentence\n\nFinding: \"Findings: There is mild pulmonary edema with superimposed region of more confluent consolidation in the left upper lung.\"\nWhat not to do: \"Findings: There is mild pulmonary edema with no regions of more confluent consolidation in the lung.\"\nWhat you should do: \u201cThere is mild pulmonary edema with no consolidation.\u201d\nExplanation: Pulmonary edema is a positive finding so you may change the sentence. However, specifying the areas of confluent consolidation is irrelevant when the finding is negated, so it should not be included.\n\nFinding: \"Descending thoracic aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic calcification seen at the arch.\"\nWhat not to do: \"Descending thoracic aorta is not tortuous with no evidence of atherosclerotic calcification.\"\nWhat you should do: \u201cAorta appears normal.\u201d\nExplanation: The aorta being tortuous with atherosclerotic calcification is a positive medical finding, so you can change the sentence. However, the location of the calcification as well as the area of the aorta is not relevant if the aorta is normal, so this information should be left out on the negation.\n\nFinding: \"Impression: New moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis in the left lung base.\"\nWhat not to do: \"Impression: New moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis in the left lung base. No pleural effusion.\"\nWhat you should do: \u201cNo pleural effusion.\u201d\nExplanation: Make sure that you are not adding or removing any sentences. For example, to negate this statement, you should not add another sentence saying \"no pleural effusion\", as this would be a contradiction, a different error type. Instead, the startin gsentence should be entirely replaced with \"no pleural effusion\".\n\nFinding: \"The right middle lobe pneumonia seen on recent CT is not clearly differentiated, but the right heart border is obscured.\"\nWhat not to do: \"No right middle lobe pneumonia is seen on recent CT.\"\nWhat you should do: \u201cNo right middle lobe pneumonia is seen on recent CT.\u201d\nExplanation: The presence of pneumonia is a positive medical finding, so you may change this sentence. You should not include \"right middle lobe\" in the negated sentence, as it does not make sense when there is no finding of pneumonia.\n\nFinding: \"Heart size top-normal.\"\nWhat not to do: \"No changes in heart size\"\nExplanation: The heart size being top normal is not a positive medical finding (it indicates the heart is normal), so no changes should be made to the sentence.\n\nAs shown in all of these examples, changing an error from present to absent is more than just changing a single word, or adding a \"not\". Think about how the radiology report would be written if the postive medical finding in question was not actually present when re-writing the sentence as a negation.\n"}
